# shodan-script (in development)

This script will scan a host (or several) to get information about it, and it wiil launch an alert if
there's a change between the current day scan and the yesterday's.

How to launch the script?

In Linux: python search.py
./search.py (another same way)

Normally, you don't need to be root user to run the script, but if you have any problem, try: sudo python search.py
